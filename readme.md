# A small project that helps me create a daily plan quicker

first, write the daily plan on plan.txt with the following rules:
- the first line indicates the date, in the format of YYYYMMDD, example: 20190718.
- write the time on a line, and the thing you want to in that time on the next line.
- the format of writing the time is HH:MM example: 02:28

And then, run `python main.py`  and you should see a p.ics on your folder

Finally you can open the p.ics and import it into your calendar app.

PS: an example of plan.txt is shown at the folder.
